# Ant Species Classification Models
This folder contains Jupyter Notebook files used for developing, training, and evaluating various deep learning models for classifying ant species. Each note book focuses on a different neural network architecture, demonstrating the process from data preparation to model evaluation.

# Contents
1. base_model.ipynb
- This notebook outlines the creation and training of a custom base model for ant species classification. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and the model architecture.
2. densenet_model.ipynb
- This notebook implements the DenseNet121 architecture, known for its densely connected layers which improve gradient flow and feature reuse.
3. efficientnet_model.ipynb
- This notebook demonstrates the use of EfficientNetB0, a model that balances model size and performance by scaling depth, width, and resolution.
4. mobilenet_model.ipynb
- This notebook covers the MobileNetV2 architecture, designed for mobile and embedded vision applications with a focus on efficiency without compromising performance.
